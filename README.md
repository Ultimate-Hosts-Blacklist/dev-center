# Ultimate Hosts Blacklist whitelisting script

This branch will help you clean your list or host file with the whitelist list which is used by the [Ultimate Hosts Blacklist](https://github.com/mitchellkrogza/Ultimate.Hosts.Blacklist) infrastructure.

## Requirements

If you want to use the script, please take the time to clone this branch and install the requirements with:

    pip3 install --user -r requirements.txt

## Complementary whitelist

Our script allow us to link a file to the system which will be used in complementary of our whitelist list.

### Special markers

If you already used a whitelist list you already know that we generaly only list all domains we want to whitelist one by one.

 It's also possible to do that with our whitelisting system but we can do more.
#### `ALL ` 

We also can use the `ALL ` marker which will tell the system to escape and regex check againt what follows.

##### INVALID characters

* `$`
    * As we automatically append `$` to the end, you should not use this character.

* `\`
    * As we automatically escape the given expression, you should not explicitly escape your regular expression when declaring an `ALL ` marker.


#### `REG ` 

We also can use the `REG ` marker which will tell the system to explicitly check for the given regex which follows the marker.

### Understanding what we actually do

If we have the following secondary whitelist list:

```
facebook.com
ALL .gov
REG face
```

our system actually create a one line regular expression which will be checked against every line. At the end on the system side for the given whitelist list we generate the following regular expression.

```re
^facebook\.com$|^www\.facebook\.com|\.gov$|face
```

Which actually means that we whitelist:

* `facebook.com` and `www.facebook.com`
* all elements which ends with `.gov`
* all elements which contain the word `face`

### INVALID characters

#### When the `ALL ` marker is used

* `$`
    * As we automatically append `$` to the end, you should not use this character.

* `\`
    * As we automatically escape the given expression, you should not explicitly escape your regular expression when declaring an `ALL ` marker.

## Usage of the script

    usage: whitelisting.py [-h] [-f FILE] [-w WHITELIST [WHITELIST ...]]
                        [-o OUTPUT]

    -f FILE, --file FILE  Read the given file and remove all element to
                            whitelist.
    -w WHITELIST [WHITELIST ...], --whitelist WHITELIST [WHITELIST ...]
                            Read the given file and append its data to the our
                            whitelist list.
